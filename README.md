# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
Handwritten character recognition is a area in research of artificial intelligence ,
computer vision, and pattern recognition. A computer system preforms a handwriting
recognition on characters in paper documents, pictures, touch-screen devices and other
sources and convert them into machine-encoded form. It basically reads of written or
printed documents which is easy for human beings, this ability can be induced in a
machine using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technique. OCR is identification
of both handwritten and printed documents using a computer.

For running the code,
Download the Dataset from the link provided in Dataset.txt

Run Train.py python code to train your device, you are free to change epochs as it can take highly more time in slower device if epochs is higher but increases the accuracy to certain extend, but still accuracy remains poor ): ):

Run Predict.py for the prediction, only a sample is provided, but other samples can be freely used.
